# Let's support Juniors

This repository is a starting point to collect information about companies worldwide **supporting and growing junior developers**.

**Juniors** are developers who are at the beginning of their career. They might:
- have just attended their first coding workshop
- be self taught
- be working students who are still studying
- be recent graduates of coding bootcamps or Rails Girls Summer of Code
- be graduating from computer science
- be career switchers

They might have a smaller set of knowledge as of yet but they are incredibly eager to explore more and learn best practice from their future colleagues.

### Situation

Many companies say they have no time, money and capacity for juniors. But if all companies continue with that mindset there won't be any seniors in the future.

Some companies open up junior positions but they expect a computer science degree or x-years of experience. We should never forget that everyone of us started somewhere small. Pre-juniors are also excited to learn and grow. Giving them a chance to grow may change their life.
