# Juniors in Berlin

### Objectives

This repository is a starting point to collect information about companies in Berlin **supporting junior developers**.  
Moreover it collects offers for **intern and junior positions** to give beginners an idea where they could apply.  
It also aims to create guidelines for **how to teach** juniors in your company.  
We can create issues and discuss in order to create a guideline of how to teach juniors.

### About us

The idea for the repo resulted from a [tweet](https://twitter.com/bitboxer/status/558921160562597890) from Bodo:
> Does someone have a list of companies in Berlin offering internships or hire junior developers? Want to talk how you guide and teach them.  

**Want to take part?** Create a PR or talk to Bodo`@bitboxer` or Malwine `@malweene`.  
Bodo is a developer at bitcrowd and is currently preparing their Junior Developer Curriculum.
Malwine works as a junior at Dawanda. Both want to encourage companies to hire and support juniors.
You canâ€™t hire seniors without someone giving juniors a chance. And that someone should be you ;)
